Code for Perth Code Dojo 2

Slides - https://speakerdeck.com/burlistic/perth-code-dojo-2-checkout

A checkout excerise designed to mirror real life requirements that might be fed in. A simple problem on the surfice with some interesting challenges. Well suited to emergent design, TDD, and refactoring.

My example using well formed professional quality JS. Use of namespaces, modular pattern, strict mode and trailed some new linting tools.

Instructions

Implement a check out that handles the following items and returns a running total

Scenario 1

Product		Cost		Special
Apples		50 cents	Buy 2 get 3rd free
Cherries	5 dollars
Mangos		3 dollars


Scenario 2

Buy 3 cherries and save 7.50


Scenario 3

20 % off Cherries

Bonus: Apply a 80% discount. What happens to your total balance?



Challenge: think of another way to implement the binary chop

Review your tests. Are all the edge cases covered?
